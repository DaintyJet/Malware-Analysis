# Buffer overflow

We will discuss buffer overflow attacks under Windows (10) through the command line argument. Here are some notes particularly related to the malicious string as the command line argument that will be fed into a victim program.
* As the command line argument, the constructed malicious string cannot contain a null byte.
* The malcious string may want to avoid reserved symbols such as "<" for the Windows command line script.

Here is the list of examples.
* [BOF-PartialOverwriting](BOF-PartialOverwriting): In main(.) of a victim program, it uses strcpy(.) to copy the user provided argument to a local buffer, which is large enough to hold small shellcode.
* [BOF-jmpesp](BOF-jmpesp): In f(.), other than main(.) of a victim program, it uses strcpy(.) to copy the user provided argument to a local buffer, which is too small to hold meaningful shellcode. We have to use another trick for an effective buffer overflow.
