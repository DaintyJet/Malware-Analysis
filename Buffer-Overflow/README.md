# Buffer overflow

We will discuss buffer overflow under Windows (10) through command line argument.

* [BOF-PartialOverwriting](BOF-PartialOverwriting): In main(.) of a victim program, it uses strcpy(.) to copy the user provided argument to a local buffer, which is large enough to hold small shellcode.
* [BOF-jmpesp](BOF-jmpesp): In f(.), other than main(.) of a victim program, it uses strcpy(.) to copy the user provided argument to a local buffer, which is too small to hold meaningful shellcode. We have to use another trick for an effective buffer overflow.
