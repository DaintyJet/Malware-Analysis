## Vulnserver as a chat server

We have to disable the [QuickEdit Mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48192465/accept-blocks-with-pending-connections-ctrlc-unblocks) and actually the Mark and Copy functionality of the Windows console too. Otherwise, the text selection mode halts the running program, e.g., our chat server. Ctrl+C can cancel the mode. However, it is really annoying. We now disable the QuickEdit Mode in the code. The *Mark* and *Copy* functionality of the console can still cause trouble if they are used by people.
