Based on Vulnserver http://www.thegreycorner.com/.

## Vulnserver as a chat server

We have to disable the [QuickEdit Mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48192465/accept-blocks-with-pending-connections-ctrlc-unblocks) and actually the Mark and Copy functionality of the Windows console too. Otherwise, the text selection mode halts running programs. Ctrl+C can disable the mode. However, it is really annoying. We now disable QuickEdit Mode in the code. The Mark and Copy functionality can still cause trouble if used by people.
