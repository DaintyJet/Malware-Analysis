# Vulnserver

The original GitHub repository is at https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver.

# Changes I made
1. Added *#include <string.h>* to essfunc.c so that it can be compiled.
2. Added *void EssentialFunc1();* to vulnserver.c so that it can be compiled.
3. Added a new command "KNOC", which has the same vulnerability as "TRUN".
