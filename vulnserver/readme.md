# Vulnserver

The original vulnserver can be found at https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver.

# Changes

1. A few minor changes are made so that essfunc.c and vulnserver.c can be compiled.
2. Added the command *KNOCK* to vulnserver. A simple chat server is added under this command. Multiple users are allowed to send messages. When one user sends a message, the message is sent to all other users who built connectiosn to the server. I referred to References [1][2][3] to write the chat server code. At the Linux side, I just used telnet to communicate with the server. With a chat server, the whole thing looks real.
